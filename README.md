## **Computer Science** | Second Year College Student

- I've been programming for about 3 years now. I've come to prefer the backend work especially when leaning towards a more *Systematic* approach. I enjoy working with others with a preference towards lower-level languages, such as Rust.

### Concepts
- I've taken a Data Structures class which went over several types of structures and algorithms
- I've also taken a Discrete Mathematics class which was really interesting
