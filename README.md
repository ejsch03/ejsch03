## **Software Engineering** | First Year College Student

- I've been programming for about 2 years now, with most of that time being at home working on individual projects. I've come to prefer the backend work especially when leaning towards a more *Systematic* approach. I enjoy working with others with a preference towards lower-level languages, such as Rust.

### Concepts
- I've taken a Data Structures class which went over a great amount of different structures such as stack, queue, heap, trees, maps, as well as a little bit about graphs. Time complexity when working with sorting/searching algorithms that make up the many structures that we worked with was a great deal of the class.
