# About Me
I am a $4^{\text{th}}$ year CS student studying at the University of Michigan Tech. I enjoy building random things as well as studying and working with the [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language, along with several other related concepts. I am especially interested in database/systematic design, concurrency, and networking.
